# üìã TODO - Development Tasks

## üö® **URGENT - Fix for Tomorrow**

### **Convex API Error - Cannot read properties of undefined**

**Priority**: HIGH - Blocking task creation functionality

**Error**:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Symbol(functionName)')
    at getFunctionAddress (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./node_modules/convex/dist/esm/server/components/paths.js:30:31)
    at getFunctionName (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./node_modules/convex/dist/esm/server/api.js:21:91)
    at useQuery (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./node_modules/convex/dist/esm/react/client.js:332:84)
    at TaskModal (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./components/TaskModal.tsx:46:80)
```

**Issue Location**: `components/TaskModal.tsx` line 46 - `useQuery(api.users.getUsers, {})`

**Attempted Fixes**:

1. ‚úÖ Cleaned and regenerated Convex types (`rm -rf convex/_generated/*` ‚Üí `npx convex codegen`)
2. ‚úÖ Restarted Convex dev server (`npx convex dev --once`)
3. ‚úÖ Verified users functions exist in function spec (`npx convex function-spec | grep "users.js"`)
4. ‚úÖ Fixed users.ts schema validation (email field optional)
5. ‚úÖ Added safety checks in TaskModal component
6. ‚úÖ Cleared Next.js cache (`rm -rf .next`)

**Status**: Functions exist in backend, types are generated, but frontend still can't access `api.users.getUsers`

**Next Steps for Tomorrow**:

1. Check if there's a version mismatch between Convex packages
2. Try recreating the `users.ts` file from scratch
3. Check if the issue is specific to the `users` module vs other modules
4. Consider temporarily removing users query and hardcoding empty array
5. Check browser network tab to see if API calls are actually being made
6. Try importing `api` differently in TaskModal
7. Check if this is a Hot Module Reload issue requiring full browser refresh

**Workaround**: Currently using safety checks, but full functionality is still broken.

**Files Affected**:

- `components/TaskModal.tsx` - Line 46 (users query)
- `convex/users.ts` - Users API functions
- `app/page.tsx` - Dashboard task creation (also affected)
