# Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Timeline

**Total Estimated Duration**: 12-16 weeks (Realistic Solo Dev Timeline)
**Current Status**: Phase 2 - Dashboard & Design System Enhanced ✅
**Next Major Milestone**: Ship Fully Functional No-AI Version (Phase 3-5)
**Philosophy**: Work Smart, Not Hard - Ship Value Early and Often
**Development Strategy**: Leverage Cursor + Claude to accelerate development
**Latest Update**: Roadmap restructured for solo developer success ✅ (January 2025)

## 🚀 Solo Developer Strategy

### **Core Philosophy: Build a Complete Product First, Then Add AI**

1. **Phases 3-5 (6 weeks)**: Build a fully functional productivity system

   - Complete task management with drag & drop
   - Working calendar with time blocking
   - Notes and project management
   - **Result**: A complete product people can actually use

2. **Phase 6 (2 weeks)**: Polish and get real users

   - Deploy to production
   - Get 10+ real users testing
   - Fix critical issues based on feedback

3. **Phases 7-8 (4 weeks)**: Add AI strategically
   - Start with "fake AI" (rule-based suggestions)
   - Validate AI UX patterns before spending on APIs
   - Add real AI only where it provides clear value

### **Key Benefits of This Approach**

✅ **Ship value early** - Users get a working product in 6 weeks
✅ **Reduce risk** - Validate product-market fit before AI complexity  
✅ **Control costs** - No expensive AI APIs until proven valuable
✅ **Learn fast** - Real user feedback drives AI feature prioritization
✅ **Stay motivated** - Constant progress with working features

## 🛠️ Technical Priorities for Solo Dev

### **Work Smart Principles**

1. **Leverage Cursor + Claude**: Use AI tools to write boilerplate and complex logic
2. **Copy-Paste Acceleration**: Reuse patterns from successful components
3. **Library over Custom**: Use proven libraries instead of building from scratch
4. **Deploy Early**: Get real feedback fast, iterate based on actual usage
5. **Focus on Value**: Build features users actually need, not "nice-to-haves"
6. **AI Last**: Prove the core system works before adding complexity

### **Technology Stack (Proven and Simple)**

- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind (already working)
- **Backend**: Convex (already working)
- **Auth**: Convex Auth (already working)
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit (well-documented)
- **Rich Text**: Tiptap (simple and powerful)
- **Calendar**: Custom component (reuse existing glassmorphic design)
- **AI**: Gemini API (cost-effective) + local rules fallback

### **Development Workflow**

1. **Use Cursor**: Let AI generate component scaffolding
2. **Start with Claude**: Describe the feature, get implementation strategy
3. **Copy Patterns**: Reuse successful patterns from existing components
4. **Test with Real Data**: Always test with realistic data scenarios
5. **Deploy Often**: Weekly deployments to catch issues early
6. **Measure Everything**: Track performance and user behavior from day 1
