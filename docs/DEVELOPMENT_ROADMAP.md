## **ðŸ§  AI IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Core AI Capabilities**

```typescript
// Natural Language Processing Pipeline
interface NLPPipeline {
  parseTask: (input: string) => ParsedTask;
  extractContext: (input: string, userHistory: Task[]) => UserContext;
  generateReasoning: (decision: string, context: any) => string;
}

// AI Decision Making
interface AIDecisionEngine {
  prioritizeTasks: (tasks: Task[], context: UserContext) => PrioritizedTasks;
  scheduleOptimally: (tasks: Task[], calendar: Event[]) => Schedule;
  suggestImprovements: (userPatterns: UserPattern[]) => Suggestion[];
}

// Learning & Adaptation
interface UserLearning {
  trackCompletion: (task: Task, actualDuration: number) => void;
