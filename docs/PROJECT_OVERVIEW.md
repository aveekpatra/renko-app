# Productivity App - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Vision

**Renko: An intelligent productivity ecosystem** that seamlessly integrates task management, project organization, calendar functionality, and note-taking through smart interconnectivity and AI-powered intelligence. Unlike traditional siloed productivity apps, Renko shows how everything connects and learns user patterns to optimize workflow efficiency.

### Core Value Propositions

1. **"See the bigger picture"** - Unlike siloed apps, Renko shows how everything connects
2. **"Work smarter, not harder"** - AI learns your patterns to optimize your workflow
3. **"No more context switching"** - Everything you need is connected and accessible
4. **"Understand your productivity"** - Analytics that lead to actionable improvements

## 🚀 Key Differentiators

### Smart Interconnectivity (Core Advantage)

- **Automatic relationship mapping**: When creating tasks, Renko suggests related projects, notes, or calendar events
- **Context switching**: Click on any item to see all connected elements (tasks → related meetings → project notes)
- **Impact visualization**: Show how completing one task affects other deadlines and projects
- **Cross-pollination insights**: Surface relevant notes/ideas when working on similar tasks

### AI-Powered Intelligence

- **Predictive scheduling**: Learn user patterns to suggest optimal task timing
- **Workload balancing**: Automatically warn about overcommitment and suggest redistributions
- **Energy-based planning**: Track when users are most productive for different task types
- **Smart batching**: Group similar tasks across projects for efficiency

### Advanced Analytics That Actually Help

- **Productivity patterns**: Not just "you completed X tasks" but "you're 40% more productive on Tuesdays when you start with creative work"
- **Bottleneck identification**: Show exactly where projects get stuck
- **Collaboration impact**: How different people/meetings affect your productivity
- **ROI tracking**: Connect time spent to actual outcomes/goals

### Unique User Experience

- **Contextual workspaces**: Interface adapts based on what you're working on
- **Natural language processing**: "Show me everything related to the Johnson project due this week"
- **Seamless mode switching**: Fluid transitions between kanban, calendar, and list views
- **Living documentation**: Notes that update automatically as projects evolve

### Integration That Goes Deeper

- **Bidirectional sync**: Changes in Renko update connected apps AND vice versa
- **Cross-platform context**: Start a task on mobile, continue on desktop with full context
- **Team transparency**: See how your work connects to teammates' without overwhelming detail

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Visual Design

- **Clean & Modern**: Minimalist interface with focus on content
- **Color System**: Blue primary (#3B82F6), semantic colors for status
- **Typography**: Geist Sans for UI, Geist Mono for code
- **Spacing**: 4px grid system (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Full theme support

### User Experience

- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design starting from mobile
- **Real-time**: Live updates across all features
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user efficiency
- **Quick Actions**: Context menus and bulk operations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide complexity until needed

### Performance Goals

- **Loading**: < 2s initial page load
- **Interactivity**: < 100ms response times
- **Real-time**: < 500ms update propagation
- **Mobile**: Optimized for 3G connections

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- **Provider**: Convex Auth with multiple providers
- **Session Management**: Server-side session handling
- **Data Access**: User-scoped queries and mutations
- **Permissions**: Role-based access for team features (future)

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Convex Auth manages sessions
2. **Real-time Queries**: Convex provides live data subscriptions
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with server sync
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and retry logic

## 🚀 Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**: `npm run dev` (Next.js + Convex)
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode throughout
3. **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier configuration
4. **Testing**: Component and integration tests (future)
5. **Deployment**: Vercel frontend + Convex backend
